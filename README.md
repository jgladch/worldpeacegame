### accreditation
[Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/) for his prolific works, which I heavily borrowed and used in both my implementation and research in trying to understand how to do this.

I also used a good amount of code from [dwtkns/d3_dymaxion](https://github.com/dwtkns/d3_dymaxion). Who, in turn, borrowed a lot of code from [Mike](http://mbostock.github.io/protovis/ex/dymax.html) [Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3712397).
